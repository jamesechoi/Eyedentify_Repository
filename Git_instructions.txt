Git User guide:
0. Create an account and download "github for windows" and "the latest version of github" from
	https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git

1. Log in and go to github.com/jimmy111c/Eyedentify_Repository

2. click 'Fork' (this creates a your 'copy' to work on)

3. In the GitHub app the repository you just forked should show up, click on 'clone' - this will 
	create a local version on your pc.
	
4. 	After making any changes open up Git Gui and browse to you local repository. All the changes you made will 
	show there. If there are any conflicts they will show here and you will have to resolce these. If not, then
	you stage all the files then commit them and then push them to your fork. (you can also do this in the 
	GitHub app by clicking commit then sync. If you no go to github.com you will see that your changes
	have been made on your fork.
	
5. Now you want to push all of your changes to your fork up to the master copy. Open git bash in your local
	repository on your drive. Enter "git remote add upstream https://github.com/jimmy111c/Eyedentify_Repository.git"
	Then enter "git push upstream" use the master login(username:jimmy111c password: ) - this then pushes
	all changes to the master repository.
